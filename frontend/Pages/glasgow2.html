Erected in 1844 to honor the Duke of Wellington, a prominent British military leader and politician, the statue originally depicted him on horseback. However, it is famously known for the traffic cone often placed on the Duke's head by locals, a playful and enduring tradition that has become a symbol of Glasgow's rebellious and humorous spirit. The cone is regularly placed and replaced, often becoming a subject of local and tourist fascination, making the statue one of the city's most photographed landmarks.</p>
